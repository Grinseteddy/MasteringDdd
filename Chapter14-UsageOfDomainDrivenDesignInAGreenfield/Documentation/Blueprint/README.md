# Blueprint Template

The blueprint template contains markdowns to write a blueprint following the logic or [arc42](https://arc42.org/) sections Introduction and Targets, Constraints, Context, and Solution Strategy. They follow consequent application of domain-driven methodologies as described in Mastering Domain-driven Design.

The template contains notes that explain the usage and content of the documentation.
Those notes should be deleted when using it.
