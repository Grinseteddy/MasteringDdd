# Constraints

> **Note:**
> Constraints limit the solution area of the product and project. They need to be listed carefully.
> There are some technology selection constraints that need to be listed.
> Otherwise should be documented if certain capabilities should be implemented or bought.
> Therefore the constraints should contain the Wardley map additionally.
